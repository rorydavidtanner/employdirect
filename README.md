# EmployDirect

## Description

EmployDirect is an app allowing staff details to be searched and results sorted by name to allow staff to find staff and businesses to increase communication between staff.

**## User Story**

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
